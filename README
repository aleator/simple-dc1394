About 
===== 

This is a simplified interface for firewire cameras based on
libdc1394 <http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/>.  

Currently CV - based images are supported with a IO based interface for
controlling the cameras. 

Plans
-----

Possible future plans include enumerator based instance and more complete functionality.

Get Involved
------------

Bug reports and especially usage reports are more than welcome!

Creating a complete support for even moderately sized C-library like libdc1394 involves a lot
of labour. Making bindings themselves are simple and mechanical and require rather little 
special skills. So, if you need some additional functionality, feel free to dig in.
